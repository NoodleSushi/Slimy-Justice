# Slimy Justice
*Published on June 11, 2018*

A disastrous event called the "Slime Massacre" has filled the court with a ton of cases, and your job as a judge is to slam your gavel to the rhythm and declare the accused guilty or innocent. This game is a submission for [Butterscotch Shenanijam 2018](https://itch.io/jam/bscotch2018).

# Developer Notes
- This the first rhythm game I have developed and released using Godot.
- Innacurate timings were inevitable due to the limitations of Godot at that time, as the `get_time_since_last_mix()` method from the Audio Server was unavailable.

# Project Setup
Install the latest [Godot Engine 3.0.x](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/3.0.6-stable/) release
